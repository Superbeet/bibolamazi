TODO LIST & THOUGHTS
====================


- Sources & filters --> combine into "plugins"


- Centralize duplicate detection mechanism, like the arXiv accessor, so that several
  filters can use the functionality if required.


- Empty line in config section terminates the command

  --> otherwise if one forgets the 'src:' or 'filter:', the given sources or command are
      interpreted as further options to the previous command, which can be very confusing.


- loggers should be cleaned up -- modules should request their logger with
  `logging.getLogger("...")`, and the log handler should only be set up in `core/main.py`.

  * Messages produced in the GUI should also use python loggers.


- What to do for repeated key names in different sources?

  * Idea: detect duplicates silently, but report error if entries are different. 
    (configurable with flag? see below?)


- Flags for bibolamazifile? e.g. what to do when one gets a repeated key name?

  * one should be able to set flags in the bibolamazi file. Add cmd e.g. `flag:` or
    `config:` ?

  * On second thought, is this really necessary? One unique behavior might be preferrable.


- Think about directly accessing Mendeley library (via API)? Is this possible?

  * How to store credentials? In a private hidden `~/.bibolamazi/` file? Don't store?
    --> might be unsafe/hinder usability/...

  * Note: this would hinder collaborations, if the required library cannot be accessed by
    other people


- Other bibliography managers?
