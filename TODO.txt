TODO LIST & THOUGHTS
====================


- Flags for bibolamazifile? e.g. what to do when one gets a repeated key name

  * one should be able to set flags in the bibolamazi file. Add cmd e.g. `flag:` or
    `config:` ?


- Think about directly accessing Mendeley library (via API)? Is this possible?

  * Note: this would hinder collaborations, if the required library cannot be accessed by
    other people
