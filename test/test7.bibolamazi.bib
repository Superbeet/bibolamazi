    abstract = "Landauer's Principle states that the work cost of erasure of one bit of information has a fundamental lower bound of kT ln(2). Here we prove a quantitative Landauer's principle for arbitrary processes, providing a general lower bound on their work cost. This bound is given by the minimum amount of (information theoretical) entropy that has to be dumped into the environment, as measured by the conditional max-entropy. The bound is tight up to a logarithmic term in the failure probability. Our result shows that the minimum amount of work required to carry out a given process depends on how much correlation we wish to retain between the input and the output systems, and that this dependence disappears only if we average the cost over many independent copies of the input state. Our proof is valid in a general framework that specifies the set of possible physical operations compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. We employ the technical toolbox of matrix majorization, which we extend and generalize to a new kind of majorization, called lambda-majorization. This allows us to formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and provide an optimal solution.",

    url = "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3618v1",
    abstract = "In this brief note, we compare two frameworks for characterizing possible operations in quantum thermodynamics. One framework considers Thermal Operations---unitaries which conserve energy. The other framework considers all maps which preserve the Gibbs state at a given temperature. Thermal Operations preserve the Gibbs state; hence a natural question which arises is whether the two frameworks are equivalent. Classically, this is true---Gibbs-Preserving Maps are no more powerful than Thermal Operations. Here, we show that this no longer holds in the quantum regime: a Gibbs-Preserving Map can generate coherent superpositions of energy levels while Thermal Operations cannot. This gap has an impact on clarifying a mathematical framework for quantum thermodynamics.",
