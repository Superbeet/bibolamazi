    title = "The thermodynamic meaning of negative entropy",
    abstract = "Landauer's erasure principle exposes an intrinsic relation between thermodynamics and information theory: the erasure of information stored in a system, S, requires an amount of work proportional to the entropy of that system. This entropy, H(S|O), depends on the information that a given observer, O, has about S, and the work necessary to erase a system may therefore vary for different observers. Here, we consider a general setting where the information held by the observer may be quantum-mechanical, and show that an amount of work proportional to H(S|O) is still sufficient to erase S. Since the entropy H(S|O) can now become negative, erasing a system can result in a net gain of work (and a corresponding cooling of the environment).",

    title = "A Quantitative Landauer's Principle",
    abstract = "Landauer's Principle states that the work cost of erasure of one bit of information has a fundamental lower bound of kT ln(2). Here we prove a quantitative Landauer's principle for arbitrary processes, providing a general lower bound on their work cost. This bound is given by the minimum amount of (information theoretical) entropy that has to be dumped into the environment, as measured by the conditional max-entropy. The bound is tight up to a logarithmic term in the failure probability. Our result shows that the minimum amount of work required to carry out a given process depends on how much correlation we wish to retain between the input and the output systems, and that this dependence disappears only if we average the cost over many independent copies of the input state. Our proof is valid in a general framework that specifies the set of possible physical operations compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. We employ the technical toolbox of matrix majorization, which we extend and generalize to a new kind of majorization, called lambda-majorization. This allows us to formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and provide an optimal solution.",

    abstract = "We study an entropy measure for quantum systems that generalizes the von Neumann entropy as well as its classical counterpart, the Gibbs or Shannon entropy. The entropy measure is based on hypothesis testing and has an elegant formulation as a semidefinite program, a type of convex optimization. After establishing a few basic properties, we prove upper and lower bounds in terms of the smooth entropies, a family of entropy measures that is used to characterize a wide range of operational quantities. From the formulation as a semidefinite program, we also prove a result on decomposition of hypothesis tests, which leads to a chain rule for the entropy.",

Based on this concept, we propose that black hole information decomposes into elementary units in the form of topological qubits, and is protected from local sources of decoherence. The topological protection mechanism ensures that the horizon of an evaporating black hole stays young and smooth.",
