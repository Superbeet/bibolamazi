    abstract = "In the absence of a reference frame for transformations associated with group G, any quantum state that is noninvariant under the action of G may serve as a token of the missing reference frame. We here present a measure of the quality of such a token: the relative entropy of frameness. This is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and the nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement, this quantity is straightforward to calculate, and we find it to be precisely equal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al. It is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be extracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum reference frame. Finally, we show how these investigations yield an approach to bounding the relative entropy of entanglement.",

In this letter, we provide general tools for checking if a function possesses this property. First we prove equivalence of asymptotic continuity with so-called robustness under admixture. This allows us to show that relative entropy distance from a convex set including a maximally mixed state is asymptotically continuous. Subsequently, we consider arrowing—a way of building a new function out of a given one. The procedure originates from constructions of intrinsic information and entanglement of formation. We show that arrowing preserves asymptotic continuity for a class of functions (so-called subextensive ones). The result is illustrated by means of several examples.",

Using this protocol one can study optimal transformations between states, and from this derive the unique measure of information. This is compared with irreversible transformations where one does not have access to noise. The ideas presented here shed some light on attempts to understand entanglement manipulations and the inevitable irreversibility encountered there where one finds that mixed states can contain “bound entanglement.”",

We develop a general framework describingthe “thermodynamic worth” of the resources with respect to reliable bit erasureor good cooling. This worth turns out to be given by the distinguishability of theresource's state from its equilibrium state in the sense of a statistical inferenceproblem. Accordingly, {Kullback—Leibler} relative information is a decisivequantity for the “worth” of the resource's state. Due to the asymmetry of relativeinformation, the reliability of the erasure process is bounded rather by the relativeinformation of the equilibrium state with respect to the actual state than by therelative information of the actual state with respect to the equilibrium state (whichis the free energy up to constants).",
