This is illustrated with an example of the diagnostics of non-classical states based on the value of the reconstructed Wigner function at the origin of the phase space. We show that such diagnostics is meaningful only when a lot of prior information on the measured quantum state is available. Our resolution measure also provides an effective tool for optimization and resolution tuning of tomography schemes.",

We are able to give an asymptotically tight separation of this form, with the "intrinsic" data quantfied by the Holevo mutual information of a certain state ensemble associated to the POVM and the source, in a model that can be viewed as the asymptotic version of the convex decomposition of POVMs into extremal ones. This result is applied to a similar separation therorem for quantum instruments and quantum operations, in their Kraus form. Finally we comment on links to related subjects: we stress the difference between data and information (in particular by pointing out that information typically is strictly less than data), derive the Holevo bound from our main result, and look at its classical case: we show that this includes the solution to the problem of extrinsic/intrinsic data separation with a known source, then compare with the well-known notion of sufficient statistics. The result on decomposition of quantum operations is used to exhibit a new aspect of the concept of entropy exchange of an open dynamics. An appendix collects several estimates for mixed state fidelity and trace norm distance, that seem to be new, in particular a construction of canonical purification of mixed states that turns out to be valuable to analyze their fidelity.},

    abstract = "Black hole complementarity, as originally formulated in the 1990's by Preskill, 't Hooft, and myself is now being challenged by the Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully firewall argument. The AMPS argument relies on an implicit assumption---the ``proximity postulate---which says that the interior of a black hole must be constructed from degrees of freedom that are physically near the black hole. The proximity postulate manifestly contradicts the idea that interior information is redundant with information in Hawking radiation, which is very far from the black hole. AMPS argue that a violation of the proximity postulate would lead to a contradiction in a thought-experiment in which Alice distills the Hawking radiation and brings a bit back to the black hole. According to AMPS the only way to protect against the contradiction is for a firewall to form at the Page time. But the measurement that Alice must make, is of such a fine-grained nature that carrying it out before the black hole evaporates may be impossible. Harlow and Hayden have found evidence that the limits of quantum computation do in fact prevent Alice from carrying out her experiment in less than exponential time. If their conjecture is correct then black hole complementarity may be alive and well. My aim here is to give an overview of the firewall argument, and its basis in the proximity postulate; as well as the counterargument based on computational complexity, as conjectured by Harlow and Hayden.",

This divides the state space into various sets, including states which are free (because they can be created under the class of operations), and those which are a resource (because they cannot be). One can quantify the worth of the resource by the relative entropy distance to the set of free states, and under certain conditions, this is a unique measure which quantifies the rate of state to state transitions. The framework includes entanglement, asymmetry and purity theory. It also includes thermodynamics, which is a hybrid resource theory combining purity theory and asymmetry. Another hybrid resource theory which merges purity theory and entanglement can be used to study quantumness of correlations and discord, and we present quantumness in this more general framework of resource theories."

    abstract = "We study a systematic procedure to find effective quantum models describing measurement data. Experiments (e.g., involving superconducting qubits) have shown that we do not always have a good understanding of how to model the measurements with positive operator valued measures (POVMs). It turns out that the ad hoc postulation of POVMs can lead to inconsistencies. For example when doing asymptotic state tomography via linear inversion, one sometime ends up with density matrices that are not positive semidefinite. We propose an alternative procedure where we do not make any a priori assumptions on the quantum model, i.e., on the Hilbert space dimension, the states or the POVMs. In this paper, we take the first steps along this program by estimating the Gram matrix associated with the states and the measurements. The Gram matrix specifies the Hilbert space dimension and determines all the states and the POVM elements, up to simultaneous rotations in the space of Hermitian matrices. We are guided by Occam's razor, i.e., we search for the minimal quantum model consistent with the data. In an upcoming paper we will show how the explicit valid density matrices and POVM elements can be found, using a heuristic algorithm that takes the state-measurement Gram matrix as input.",

We show that almost all sets of O(rd log\^{}6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the rank-r restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered from a fixed ("universal") set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error. A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal operator basis whose elements have small operator norm. Our proof uses Dudley's inequality for Gaussian processes, together with bounds on covering numbers obtained via entropy duality.},

In the classical case, if the receiver has some prior information about the messages being conveyed, less communication is needed. Here we explore the concept of prior quantum information: given an unknown quantum state distributed over two systems, we determine how much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full state to one system. This communication measures the partial information one system needs, conditioned on its prior information. We find that it is given by the conditional entropy--a quantity that was known previously, but lacked an operational meaning. In the classical case, partial information must always be positive, but we find that in the quantum world this physical quantity can be negative. If the partial information is positive, its sender needs to communicate this number of quantum bits to the receiver; if it is negative, then sender and receiver instead gain the corresponding potential for future quantum communication. We introduce a protocol that we term 'quantum state merging' which optimally transfers partial information. We show how it enables a systematic understanding of quantum network theory, and discuss several important applications including distributed compression, noiseless coding with side information, multiple access channels and assisted entanglement distillation.",

In the context of Maxwell's demon, it is often stated that measurement has no minimum energy cost, while information has a work value. However, as we elucidate, the first of these statements does not refer to the cost paid by the measuring device. Here we show that it is only when a measuring device has access to a zero-temperature reservoir—that is, never—that measurement requires no energy. To obtain a given amount of information, all measuring devices must pay a cost equal to that which a heat engine would pay to obtain the equivalent work value of that information."

A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science, the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.",

Here we establish the validity of this law for the infall of an entropy-bearing system into a much larger and more massive generic stationary black hole. To do this we determine a general lower bound for the increase in black-hole entropy, and an upper bound for the entropy of the system, while allowing for quantum effects at each stage. In passing we show that the generalized second law is a statistical law which becomes over-whelmingly probable in the limit of a macroscopic system. We also consider briefly more general situations. Finally, we give two simple examples of predictions made by the generalized second law for black-hole formation processes.",

    abstract = "Intuitively, if a density operator has small rank, then it should be easier to estimate from experimental data, since in this case only a few eigenvectors need to be learned. We prove two complementary results that confirm this intuition. First, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using fewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases with the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions about the unknown state. We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we obtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data contains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements. Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed sensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing estimators consistently produce higher-fidelity state reconstructions than MLE. In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster classical processing with no loss of accuracy. Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low rank estimate using direct fidelity estimation and we describe a method for compressed quantum process tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank.",

Taking as our work storage system a 'weight' we prove the second law and then present simple protocols which extract average work equal to the free energy change of the system - the same amount as in classical thermodynamics. Crucially, for systems in 'classical' states (mixtures of energy eigenstates) our protocol works on a single copy of the system. This is in sharp contrast to previous results, which showed that in case of almost-deterministic work extraction, collective actions on multiple copies are necessary to extract the free energy. This establishes the fact that free energy is a meaningful notion even for individual systems in classical states. However, for non-classical states, where coherences between energy levels exist, we prove that collective actions are necessary, so long as no external sources of coherence are used.",

We give a criterion for decoupling in terms of two smooth entropies, one quantifying the amount of initial correlation between A and E, and the other characterizing the mapping that describes the evolution of A. The criterion applies to arbitrary such mappings and is tight if the mapping satisfies certain natural conditions. Decoupling has a number of applications both in physics and information theory, e.g., as a building block for quantum information processing protocols.

This result generalizes Winter's measurement compression theorem for fixed independent and identically distributed inputs [Winter, CMP 244 (157), 2004] to arbitrary inputs, and more importantly, it identifies the quantum mutual information of a measurement as the information gained by performing it, independent of the input state on which it is performed. Our result is a generalization of the classical reverse Shannon theorem to quantum-to-classical channels. In this sense, it can be seen as a quantum reverse Shannon theorem for quantum-to-classical channels, but with the entanglement assistance and quantum communication replaced by shared randomness and classical communication, respectively. The proof is based on a novel one-shot state merging protocol for "classically coherent states" as well as the post-selection technique for quantum channels, and it uses techniques developed for the quantum reverse Shannon theorem [Berta et al., CMP 306 (579), 2011].},

In this paper, we deal with a basic model of the memory, that is, a system including a particle making the Brownian motion in a time-dependent potential well, and show that Landauer’s claim holds rigorously if the random force acting on the particle is white and Gaussian. Our proof is based on the fact that the analogue of the second law of thermodynamics dQ≤kBTdS holds rigorously by virtue of the Fokker-Planck equation, even if the potential is not static. Using the above result, we also discuss the counterargument of Goto et al. to Landauer’s claim based on the quantum flux parametron.",

We consider a box full of entropy lowered toward and then dropped into a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in equilibrium with thermal radiation. We avoid the approximation that the buoyant pressure varies slowly across the box, and compute the buoyant force exactly. We find, in agreement with independent investigations, that the neutral point generically lies very near the horizon. A consequence is that in the generic case the Unruh-Wald entropy restriction is neither necessary nor sufficient for enforcement of the generalized second law. Another consequence is that generically the buoyancy makes only a negligible contribution to the energy bookkeeping, so that the original entropy bound is recovered if the generalized second law is assumed to hold. The number of particle species does not figure in the entropy bound, a point that has caused some perplexity. We demonstrate by explicit calculation that, for an arbitrarily large number of particle species, the bound is indeed satisfied by cavity thermal radiation in the thermodynamic regime, provided vacuum energies are included. We also show directly that thermal radiation in a cavity in D-dimensional space also respects the bound regardless of the value of D. As an application of the bound we show that it strongly restricts the information capacity of the posited black hole remnants, so that they cannot serve to resolve the information paradox.},

This is often generalised to the claim that any logically irreversible operation cannot be implemented in a thermodynamically reversible way. Norton [2005. Eaters of the lotus: Landauer's principle and the return of Maxwell's demon. Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 36, 375–411] and Maroney [2005.

Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 36, 355–374] both argue that Landauer's Principle has not been shown to hold in general, and Maroney offers a method that he claims instantiates the operation Reset in a thermodynamically reversible way. In this paper we defend the qualitative form of Landauer's Principle, and clarify its quantitative consequences (assuming the second law of thermodynamics). We analyse in detail what it means for a physical system to implement a logical transformation L, and we make this precise by defining the notion of an L-machine. Then we show that logical irreversibility of L implies thermodynamic irreversibility of every corresponding L-machine. We do this in two ways. First, by assuming the phenomenological validity of the Kelvin statement of the second law, and second, by using information-theoretic reasoning. We illustrate our results with the example of the logical transformation ‘Reset’, and thereby recover the quantitative form of Landauer's Principle.",

This Gram matrix determines the density matrices and the POVM elements uniquely up to simultaneous rotations (with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product) in the vector space of Hermitian matrices. However, when the description of the experiment needs to be connected to textbook quantum mechanics, explicit expressions for the states and the POVM elements in terms of positive semidefinite matrices are required. In this paper, we describe a heuristic algorithm that takes the state-meaurement Gram matrix as input and searches explicit realizations of this Gram matrix in terms of quantum mechanically valid density matrices and POVM elements.",

The theory of entanglement is perhaps the best-known and most well-understood resource theory in this sense. Here we return to the basic questions of thermodynamics using the formalism of resource theories developed in quantum information theory and show that the free energy of thermodynamics emerges naturally from the resource theory of energy-preserving transformations. Specifically, the free energy quantifies the amount of useful work which can be extracted from asymptotically-many copies of a quantum system when using only reversible energy-preserving transformations and a thermal bath at fixed temperature. The free energy also quantifies the rate at which resource states can be reversibly interconverted asymptotically, provided that a sublinear amount of coherent superposition over energy levels is available, a situation analogous to the sublinear amount of classical communication required for entanglement dilution.",

This raises the question of the `truly' work-like energy that can extracted. Here we consider an alternative that corresponds to an essentially fluctuation-free extraction.

This serves as a basis for the Landauer principle, which puts a lower bound Tln2 for the heat generated by erasure of one bit of information. Here we show that in the world of quantum entanglement this law is broken. A quantum Brownian particle interacting with its thermal bath can either generate less heat or even absorb heat during an analogous squeezing process, due to entanglement with the bath. The effect exists even for weak but fixed coupling with the bath, provided that temperature is low enough. This invalidates the Landauer bound in the quantum regime, and suggests that quantum carriers of information can be more efficient than assumed so far.",

Fascination with the demon persisted throughout the development of statistical and quantum physics, information theory, and computer science, and links have been established between Maxwell's demon and each of these disciplines. The demon's seductive quality makes it appealing to physical scientists, engineers, computer scientists, biologists, psychologists, and historians and philosophers of science.Since the publication of Maxwell's Demon: Entropy, Information, Computing in 1990, Maxwell's demon has been the subject of renewed and increased interest by numerous researchers in the fields mentioned above. Updated and expanded, Maxwell's Demon 2: Entropy, Classical and Quantum Information, Computing retains many of the seminal papers that appeared in the first edition, including the original thoughts of James Clerk Maxwell and William Thomson; a historical review by Martin Klein; and key articles by Leo Szilard, Leon Brillouin, Rolf Landauer, and Charles Bennett that led to new branches of research on the demon. This second edition contains newer articles by Landauer, Bennett, and others, related to Landauer's principle; connections with quantum mechanics; algorithmic information; and the thermodynamics and limits of computation. The book also includes two separate bibliographies: an alphabetical listing by author and a chronological bibliography that is annotated by the editors and contains selected quotes from the books and articles listed.

A simple example of the latter is when an atom is put into a superposition of two energy levels, using coherent radiation in form of a laser. The question is to what extent the coherence is degraded when utilized. Here we show that coherence can be turned into a catalytic resource, meaning that it can be used indefinitely to induce coherent operations without ever being degraded. As an application we consider quantum thermodynamics, where we demonstrate that access to sufficient coherence enables the release of all latent expected work content in a system. Since we can make it a catalyst, no coherence is spent to achieve this work extraction. In a wider perspective, the fact that coherence can be made catalytic provides a step towards a characterization of the relation between energy and coherence as resources in quantum statistical mechanics."

    abstract = "Winter’s measurement compression theorem stands as one of the most penetrating insights of quantum information theory. In addition to making an original and profound statement about measurement in quantum theory, it also underlies several other general protocols used for entanglement distillation and local purity distillation. The theorem provides for an asymptotic decomposition of any quantum measurement into noise and information . This decomposition leads to an optimal protocol for having a sender simulate many independent instances of a quantum measurement and send the measurement outcomes to a receiver, using as little communication as possible. The protocol assumes that the parties have access to some amount of common randomness, which is a strictly weaker resource than classical communication. In this review, we provide a second look at Winter’s measurement compression theorem, detailing the information processing task, giving examples for understanding it, reviewing Winter’s achievability proof, and detailing a new approach to its single-letter converse theorem. We prove an extension of the theorem to the case in which the sender is not required to receive the outcomes of the simulated measurement. The total cost of common randomness and classical communication can be lower for such a ‘non-feedback’ simulation, and we prove a single-letter converse theorem demonstrating optimality. We then review the Devetak–Winter theorem on classical data compression with quantum side information, providing new proofs of its achievability and converse parts. From there, we outline a new protocol that we call ‘measurement compression with quantum side information,’ announced previously by two of us in our work on triple trade-offs in quantum Shannon theory. This protocol has several applications, including its part in the ‘classically-assisted state redistribution’ protocol, which is the most general protocol on the static side of the quantum information theory tree, and its role in reducing the classical communication cost in a task known as local purity distillation. We also outline a connection between measurement compression with quantum side information and recent work on entropic uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory. Finally, we prove a single-letter theorem characterizing measurement compression with quantum side information when the sender is not required to obtain the measurement outcome.",

We investigate the conditional min- and max-entropy for quantum states, generalizations of classical R\'{e}nyi entropies. We introduce the purified distance, a novel metric for unnormalized quantum states and use it to define smooth entropies as optimizations of the min- and max-entropies over a ball of close states. We explore various properties of these entropies, including data-processing inequalities, chain rules and their classical limits. The most important property is an entropic formulation of the asymptotic equipartition property, which implies that the smooth entropies converge to the von Neumann entropy in the limit of many independent copies. The smooth entropies also satisfy duality and entropic uncertainty relations that provide limits on the power of two different observers to predict the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system. Finally, we discuss three example applications of the smooth entropy framework. We show a strong converse statement for source coding with quantum side information, characterize randomness extraction against quantum side information and prove information theoretic security of quantum key distribution using an intuitive argument based on the entropic uncertainty relation.",

Ideas such as Landauer's erasure principle and information assisted work extraction have greatly contributed not only to enlarge our understanding about the fundamental limits imposed by nature, but also to enlighten the path for practical implementations of information processing devices. The intricate information-thermodynamics relation also entails a fundamental limit on parameter estimation, establishing a thermodynamic cost for information acquisition. More specifically, we show that the amount of information that can be encoded in a physical system (and consequently extracted) by means of any process is limited by the dissipated work during the implementation of the process. This includes a thermodynamic trade-off for information acquisition. Likewise, any information acquisition process is ultimately limited by the second law of thermodynamics. Such a trade-off may find applications in several areas of knowledge, since parameter estimation lies in the building basis of all natural sciences and several technological applications, such as metrology.",

We then find that the engine can be driven by purely quantum information, expressed as the so-called quantum discord, forming a part of the quantum mutual information.

After an introduction of all the necessary quantum mechanical and information theoretical concepts we analyse Landauer's principle which states that the erasure of information is inevitably accompanied by the generation of heat. We employ this principle to rederive a number of results in classical and quantum information theory whose rigorous mathematical derivations are difficult. This demonstrates the usefulness of Landauer's principle and provides an introduction to the physical theory of information.",
